# e-library (BookBasement)
This website is built by the total of 4 people. We are heading to a page that looks quite familiar to reader.

##### Introduction ##########
Base on the project our group chose in the beginning of the SE course, this "BookBasement" is like an electronic library where you guys can search and find out some basic information about the books you love...

#### Brief Description ######
Joining the introductory course in software engineering, we were assigned to build a software with 4 members. Our team decided to build a software that runs on a website about book storage (Book basement) because books play an important role in the development of human knowledge and need to be stored and shared with everyone. . This is software used to collect and store book information.
First, the software will have 2 modes: user with account and current user (guest). To have an account, the user will register with a username and password; In addition, users can also log in with email or facebook.
For guest accounts, users will be able to search for their favorite book information with the search bar. Besides, they can also upload good books and share them with other users.
The “like” function on book information is also possible for guest accounts. After viewing the information and reading the book, if you like the content of the book, the user can click "like". This will help increase the popularity of the book because other users can see the number of “likes” and choose the book.
Some users when entering the website may not know which book to choose. Therefore, the "top view" function will suggest to users which books have a lot of hits and likes for users to refer to.
This software certainly cannot lack the function of dividing by category. User can choose favorite book genre; From there the site will display the corresponding books. This is an important function because searching by title is not always ideal and it will greatly affect the user experience.
For users with an account, they will certainly be able to use the above functions as well. However, the software will provide some other functions such as:
Comments: After viewing the information and reading through the book, users can return to the site and leave some comments about the book. In addition, some users will also rely on comments to decide whether to read the book or not.
Favorites list: With this function, users save books they like for later re-reading as well as recommending to others.

##### Reason & Purpose #######
This project is a huge part for the assessment in the end of the course - Introduction to Software Engineering
